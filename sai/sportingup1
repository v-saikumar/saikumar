1. I do not know if Shopify lets you FTP in, but I was thinking you could just connect to the server, download everything that Shopify lets you download, and zip up the contents. 

sol: 1. Shopify provides access to the stores' files by the admin and the database via the API, but Shopify systems are not accessible via ftp 		for security and data integrity.

	2. Shopify FTP Proxy. This runs a local FTP server (on localhost) that will communicate with Shopify over HTTP API and allows 			you to upload/download/edit your theme files and assets using your favorite FTP client. Note: this tool is built with Node.js 			and is installed via npm so make sure to have Node installed.

2. The products are synced from ChannelAdvisor and constantly changing so there's no need to back up those. It is my understanding that the Collections are not created through channel advisor so those would be good to have backed up as well ?

<div class="select clearfix"{% if hide_default_title %} style="display: none" {% endif %}>
  <select id="product-select" name="id">

    <option value = "{{ variant.id}}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>
    
  {% endfor %}
    
  </select>
  
  {% if product.available and product.variants.size > 1 %}
  {% for option in product.options %}
    {% include 'swatch' with option %}
  {% endfor %}
